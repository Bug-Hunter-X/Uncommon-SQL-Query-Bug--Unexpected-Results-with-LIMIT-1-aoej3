This repository contains an example of a subtle bug that can occur in SQL queries when using the LIMIT clause within a subquery. The bug arises when the subquery may return more than one row, leading to unpredictable behavior. The solution demonstrates how to handle such cases using more robust techniques such as JOINs or WHERE IN clause. Please find detailed information and solutions within the files.
